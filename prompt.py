    "The script should analyze email messages (provided in a JSON array format below) and decide if Fiona should reply. "
    "The `filter.py` script must include:\n\n"
    "1. Imports for `re` and `json` (and any other standard Python libraries necessary).\n"
    "2. A comprehensive list of compiled regular expressions named `FILTER_PATTERNS`. These patterns should identify and help exclude emails such as:\n"
    "    - Out of office / vacation auto-replies (e.g., 'Out of Office', 'OOO', 'Away Until', 'On holiday', 'Currently out', 'will be back on').\n"
    "    - Standard automated replies (e.g., 'Thanks for your email', 'message received', 'auto-reply', 'automatic response').\n"
    "    - DMARC reports or similar technical/administrative emails (e.g., subjects starting with 'Report Domain').\n"
    "    - One-time passcodes or security alerts.\n"
    "    - Inquiries about Fiona paying for services, collaborations, or discussing rates/charges (e.g., 'I charge', 'my rate is', 'flat fee', 'how much do you pay', 'collaboration fee').\n"
    "    - Explicitly negative or uninterested replies (e.g., 'not interested', 'unsubscribe', 'remove me', 'stop emailing').\n"
    "    - Emails with overly aggressive or inappropriate language.\n"
    "3. A function `def should_reply(message: dict) -> tuple[bool, str]:`\n"
    "    - It takes a single email message dictionary as input. Each message dictionary will have `id`, `from`, `subject`, and `body` (containing the full, plain text email body) keys.\n"
    "    - It should check the `subject` and `body` of the message against `FILTER_PATTERNS`.\n"
    "    - It must return a tuple: `(True, \"REASON_TO_REPLY\")` if Fiona should reply, or `(False, \"REASON_TO_FILTER\")` if she should not. \n"
    "    - The second element of the tuple (the reason string) should be a concise explanation for the decision (e.g., 'Genuine question', 'Out of office', 'Discussing rates').\n"
    "4. A `if __name__ == '__main__':` block that demonstrates how to:\n"
    "    - Load messages from `replies.json` (assuming it's in the same directory).\n"
    "    - Iterate through each message.\n"
    "    - Call `should_reply()` for each message.\n"
    "    - Print the `id`, `subject`, and the decision (Reply/Filter) and reason for a representative sample of messages (e.g., the first 10-20 messages, and a few examples of filtered and not-filtered messages if possible).\n\n"
    "Prioritize accuracy in filtering. The goal is to help Fiona focus her time on meaningful interactions. "
