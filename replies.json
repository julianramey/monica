(i'm talking millions of followers)\ud83e\uddcd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nShocker, right??!\nThe only difference is they have a manager that does it for them...\nNow, eventually you will get a manager (i believe in youu!)\nBut in the meantime, you need someone or yourself to be reaching out to brands to grow your portfolio...\nI\u2019m not going to say that brands won't reach out to you, because they will, and it's a great feeling!!\nHowever, 90% of the time when a brand reaches out to you, they offer horrible rates, ask you for way too much, and overall are just a headache. (TRUST ME, i've had too many to count)\u2026\nThe ABSOLUTE best way to grow your account and portfolio will be reaching to brands yourself.\nYou set the rates, how much work you have to do, and become your own boss.\nIf this sounds like you, then\nclick here.\nYou will also learn everything about the process, so when you do get a manager, you will be able to tell if they know what they are doing or if they are scamming you. (happens much more than you would think)!!\nMaybe you already know the importance of reaching out to brands, and if you do I highly suggest grabbing influencer insider, as I teach you the method no one is sharing, to gain access to DECISION MAKERS at these big companies!!\nAndy from customer service that manages\nhi@rhode.com\ndoesn't care about your videos (Andy's a hater anyway) but the director of marketing?! you KNOW she does, or she better\u2026\nLook my point is that you need to be contacting brands and you NEED to be contacting the RIGHT people at these brands. Otherwise it's just sending emails into a black hole.\n5 - 10 emails sent to the right person could be difference between you and a $3000 deal. that's how fast it can change!!! \ud83e\udd2d\nIf you want to grow your portfolio and get paid faster than anyone you know, then this is for you.\nIn influencer insider i teach you everything about how to find the RIGHT people & their emails.\nNot only that, but how to write an email that will get replies.\nI\u2019ve read literally thousands of emails sent to Frilliance and I can tell you first hand which ones worked and which ones didn\u2019t make the cut.\nGirls that have joined influencer insider have reached out to brands with what I taught them and have received replies from major brands already.\nGlow recipe, Skims, Glossier, just to name a few. :)\nThis stuff WORKS.\nLearn How to Find the Right People\nI PROMISE you it will save you hours (probably days lol) and get you so much closer to where you deserve to be!!!\nUnsubscribe\nView in browser"

I\u2019ll share all the details in my next email!\nSpoiler:\nIt\u2019s a simple system I created after seeing the influencer world from both sides:\nAs a content creator\nwith 1M+ YouTube subscribers\nAs a brand owner\nwho\u2019s sent out thousandsss of PR boxes and negotiated 6-figure deals\nI call it\nInfluencer Insider\n, and it\u2019s available in just a couple of days (for a crazy-low price, btw). But before we get to the official details, I had to make sure we\u2019re on the same page about one thing:\nYes\n\u2014I\u2019m the real Fiona, and\nyes\n, I\u2019m genuinely here to help smaller creators land the brand deals they deserve!!!\nThank you for being here\u2014and for trusting me enough to open these emails.

Research the right contact person - Never send to generic \"info@\" emails (they're literally black holes for PR requests a NO NO)\n2. Customize each email outreach - Brands can smell a copy-pasted template from miles away\ud83e\uddcd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f(it shows brands your not that interested in them)\n3. Show specific value - Explain exactly how your content style matches their brand (with screenshot examples to stand out!)\n4. Follow up strategically - The magic often happens in the follow-up (I'll share my exact timeline below)\n5. Stand out visually - Use design elements (or photos) in your email! That make you instantly memorable!! \u2728\nAnd here are the 5 things that get your emails deleted immediately:\nDON'T:\n1. Focus on follower count - Starting with \"I have X followers\" screams amateur ah!\n2. Write paragraphs about yourself - Brands care about what you can do for THEM \ud83d\udc40\n3. Use generic compliments - \"I love your brand!\" means nothing without specifics details.\n4. Send the same message to competitors - Brands talk to each other more than you think\u2026\n5. Give up after one attempt - most successful PR partnerships happen after the 2nd or 3rd contact! :)\nIf you missed my last email with the list of 20 brands actively seeking micro influencers right now,\nclick here.\nBeing an influencer (making money & getting PR) is tough, which is why I'm sharing these insider secrets most established creators won't tell you. I've been on both sides of this, and I want to be the guide I wish I had!! Because OH MY\u2026 it can be overwhelming.\nALSO Here\u2019s the most successful follow-up schedule I've seen is: first email \u2192 wait 5 days \u2192 follow-up #1 \u2192 wait 7 days \u2192 follow-up #2.

Starting May 21st, we're challenging you to create something awesome using Postmark's Inbound Email Processing.\nLearn more\nWhat's the challenge about?\nIt's delightfully straightforward: build something cool that uses Postmark's Inbound Email Processing. That's it!\nMaybe you'll create an email-powered CMS where content managers can publish by simply sending an email. Or perhaps an AI assistant that users interact with entirely through their inbox. The only limit is your imagination (and the June 1st deadline).\nThe important details:\n\ud83d\udcc5 Challenge kicks off: May 21st, 2025\n\ud83d\udce8 Submissions due: June 1st, 2025 (23:59 PT)\n\ud83c\udfc6 Winners announced: June 12th, 2025\n\ud83d\udcb0 Prizes: $3,000 up for grabs! The top three entries will get $1,000 USD\nWhy participate?\nBesides the obvious (prizes! bragging rights!), this is your chance to explore one of Postmark's most powerful but sometimes overlooked features. Inbound Processing transforms your application from a one-way messenger to a two-way conversation hub.\nCheck out our\nfull announcement post\nfor inspiration, resources, and all the technical details to get started.\nReady to build something awesome? We can't wait to see what you come up with!\nHappy coding,\nThe Postmark Team\nWhat did you think of this email?\n\u2708\ufe0f Not my thing\n\ud83d\ude10 Okay\n\u2764\ufe0f Great!\nRead this online\n-\nUnsubscribe\nSent to:\nhey@influencerinsider.club\nPostmark, 1 North Dearborn St, 5th floor, Chicago, IL 60602, United States"

Stackeddd!!)\nJust a few months ago, she was in a totally different spot\u2026\nShe was putting in effort, creating cute content, reaching out to brands but\u2026 barely getting any replies.\nShe felt so overwhelmed and frustrated, because she was seeing girls with similar content, get brand deals and PR responses.\nThen she got our email inviting her to test the Influencer Insider system \u2014 and she said, \u201cWhy not? What\u2019s the worst that can happen?!\u201d\nFast forward to now\u2026 \ud83e\udd2d\nShe\u2019s getting 3\u20135 PR packages a WEEK. YAY!\nShe\u2019s already made over $1,250 in paid brand deals. AMAZING!!\nAnd she has just 6.2k followers!!\nLike\u2026 are you kidding?! That\u2019s what happens when you believe in yourself and use the right strategy!\nInside Influencer Insider, I break down exactly what she did:\nHow to find the right brand contacts\nCreate emails they can\u2019t ignore\nTurn PR into paid opportunities\nCreate content that gets noticed (and reposted!)\nI\u2019m not promising overnight success. She showed up, stayed consistent, and followed every step. But she\u2019s proof that it works!!\nAnd guess what? I\nknow\nyou can do it too!!\nJoin Influencer Insider today for a one time payment of $28.00 (not a subscription)\u2014 it\u2019s worth WAY more, think of all the success you can absolutely have!\nBecause this is about\nsupporting you\n\u2014 not gatekeeping the industry secrets!! too many gatekeepers in this world!\nClick Here To Join Influencer Insider\nAnd I\u2019m ALSO including my personal contact list of 300+ brand emails.

Or click here to see me talking more about this:\nTikTok Video (It's around the 2 minute mark)\nGoogle \u201cFrilliance CVS Walmart\u201d\nYou\u2019ll see images of my beauty brand, Frilliance, on store shelves (so cool ah!!) and some press coverage about it. I started my brand in 2016 and built it brick by brick (lotsss of work lol) it\u2019s very real.\nEmails from Influencer Insider\nWe\u2019re sending from influencerinsider.club, but it\u2019s all connected to me, Fiona, and my team. I\u2019d never risk my brand or reputation on anything sketchy. Ever!! I\u2019m here to help, it\u2019s what I have always loved doing\u2014creating solutions!\nIf you\u2019re still on the fence, hopefully some Google or TikTok searches will help lol! If you are excited to dive deeper into the influencer world:\nComing Up Next: The Bigger System\nI\u2019ve hinted at a\ncomplete, step-by-step system\nto not just\none\nor 2 PR boxes, but to build ongoing paid collaborations with brands that truly value you, regardless of follower count (there\u2019s so many ways you can offer value). I\u2019ll share all the details in my next email!\nSpoiler:\nIt\u2019s a simple system I created after seeing the influencer world from both sides:\nAs a content creator\nwith 1M+ YouTube subscribers\nAs a brand owner\nwho\u2019s sent out thousandsss of PR boxes and negotiated 6-figure deals\nI call it\nInfluencer Insider\n, and it\u2019s available in just a couple of days (for a crazy-low price, btw). But before we get to the official details, I had to make sure we\u2019re on the same page about one thing:\nYes\n\u2014I\u2019m the real Fiona, and\nyes\n, I\u2019m genuinely here to help smaller creators land the brand deals they deserve!!!\nThank you for being here\u2014and for trusting me enough to open these emails. It means the world.\nMuch love,\nFiona\nUnsubscribe\nView in browser"

Right before everything turns around!!\nBack in 2013, I spent 3 months creating the\nperfect\nbeauty content.\nMy lighting was great, my edits were clean, and I was posting consistently.\nMy follower count was slowly growing, but brands weren't noticing me\u2026\nOnly the weirdest companies (vacuum companies & gaming apps lolll)\nSo I did what I thought would work\u2026 I sent 47 DMs to beauty brands I loved, each one carefully crafted with compliments about their products.\nI was SO excited about the potential PR packages and brand deals headed my way!!\nThe response??!\nAbsolutely nothing. Well actually 2 polite rejections.\ud83e\uddcd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nI was sooo confused. I watched other creators with FEWER followers than me unboxing beautiful PR boxes.\nWhat were they doing that I wasn't??!\nThe turning point came when I accidentally made friends with a PR manager at a event in LA.\nAfter a few phone calls, she confessed something that changed everythinggg for me!!\nLater that day, she showed me the email templates her and her team use and ways to find brand contacts!!\nSUCH A QUEEN.\nAnd what I saw shocked me\u2014the successful pitches/emails looked NOTHING like what I'd been sending\u2026.\nI starting using her tips that week:\nI found the right email contacts instead of DMing (NOT\nPr@brand.com\neither)\nI created a visual email that stood out (more tips coming)\nI structured my pitch around the brand's needs, not mine\nI followed up consistently using her recommended schedule (this worked wonders!!!)\nWithin 30 days, I received my first PR package from a major brand and had brands wanting to PAY ME!!!\nWhich was a huge step for me!!\n3 months later, my doorstep was flooded with packages, including brands I'd previously been ignored by. \ud83e\udd2d\nA year later going on brand trips!!!! (First one was with Emma chamberlain & so many incredible influencers)\nThe crazy part? The ONLY thing that changed was how I approached brands!!\nI'm sharing this because I don't want you to waste months like I did.\nIn tomorrow's email, I'm sending you a free template that's helped girls in my community land their first PR partnerships!! :)\nYour perfectly packaged PR & brand relationships that PAYYY is closer than you think!\nMuch love,\nFiona\nP.S. 2 of my close friends are influencer managers and\u00a0 90% of influencers approach brands completely wrong.

I will post all 5 videos to my main account\r\n(@amber.mercier). I also have two backup accounts\u2026 one is a midsize\r\nfashion niche (@midsizemom) and the other is mom content mostly toys\r\n(@merciermom) if you\u2019d be more interested in me posting on those.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus I will post those videos to my Amazon influencer account. I\r\nwill also provide the ad codes with an agreement that my commission\r\nrate won\u2019t change.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for UGC work I\u2019d love to discuss the deliverables and my rates\r\n\r\nI\u2019m looking forward to hopefully starting a lasting partnership.\r\n\r\n-Amber Mercier .\r\n\r\n--\nMedia Kit\r\n@meetthemerciers"

Customize each email outreach - Brands can smell a copy-pasted template from miles away\ud83e\uddcd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f(it shows brands your not that interested in them)\n3. Show specific value - Explain exactly how your content style matches their brand (with screenshot examples to stand out!)\n4. Follow up strategically - The magic often happens in the follow-up (I'll share my exact timeline below)\n5. Stand out visually - Use design elements (or photos) in your email! That make you instantly memorable!! \u2728\nAnd here are the 5 things that get your emails deleted immediately:\nDON'T:\n1. Focus on follower count - Starting with \"I have X followers\" screams amateur ah!\n2. Write paragraphs about yourself - Brands care about what you can do for THEM \ud83d\udc40\n3. Use generic compliments - \"I love your brand!\" means nothing without specifics details.\n4. Send the same message to competitors - Brands talk to each other more than you think\u2026\n5. Give up after one attempt - most successful PR partnerships happen after the 2nd or 3rd contact! :)\nIf you missed my last email with the list of 20 brands actively seeking micro influencers right now,\nclick here.\nBeing an influencer (making money & getting PR) is tough, which is why I'm sharing these insider secrets most established creators won't tell you. I've been on both sides of this, and I want to be the guide I wish I had!! Because OH MY\u2026 it can be overwhelming.\nALSO Here\u2019s the most successful follow-up schedule I've seen is: first email \u2192 wait 5 days \u2192 follow-up #1 \u2192 wait 7 days \u2192 follow-up #2. This simple rhythm has tripled PR acceptance rates for my community members!!\nMuch love,\nFiona\nP.S.

Let\u2019s do it!\u201d\nI literally screamedddd. I\u2019d finally cracked the code!!\nAnd I want you to experience that too \ud83e\udef6\nSo, before you send your next brand outreach email, ask yourself:\nDoes this stand out? Would I reply to this if I were the brand?\nIf not,\nrewrite it.\nMake it\nbold\n. Make it\ndifferent\n. Make it\nirresistible\n!!!\nThis is how you\nstop looking like everyone else\n\u2014and start getting on PR lists, building real relationships, and turning gifting into paid deals!\nYou. got. this!!!\nMuch love,\nFiona\nP.S.

Well actually 2 polite rejections.\ud83e\uddcd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nI was sooo confused. I watched other creators with FEWER followers than me unboxing beautiful PR boxes.\nWhat were they doing that I wasn't??!\nThe turning point came when I accidentally made friends with a PR manager at a event in LA.\nAfter a few phone calls, she confessed something that changed everythinggg for me!!\nLater that day, she showed me the email templates her and her team use and ways to find brand contacts!!\nSUCH A QUEEN.\nAnd what I saw shocked me\u2014the successful pitches/emails looked NOTHING like what I'd been sending\u2026.\nI starting using her tips that week:\nI found the right email contacts instead of DMing (NOT\nPr@brand.com\neither)\nI created a visual email that stood out (more tips coming)\nI structured my pitch around the brand's needs, not mine\nI followed up consistently using her recommended schedule (this worked wonders!!!)\nWithin 30 days, I received my first PR package from a major brand and had brands wanting to PAY ME!!!\nWhich was a huge step for me!!\n3 months later, my doorstep was flooded with packages, including brands I'd previously been ignored by. \ud83e\udd2d\nA year later going on brand trips!!!! (First one was with Emma chamberlain & so many incredible influencers)\nThe crazy part?

Stackeddd!!)\nJust a few months ago, she was in a totally different spot\u2026\nShe was putting in effort, creating cute content, reaching out to brands but\u2026 barely getting any replies.\nShe felt so overwhelmed and frustrated, because she was seeing girls with similar content, get brand deals and PR responses.\nThen she got our email inviting her to test the Influencer Insider system \u2014 and she said, \u201cWhy not? What\u2019s the worst that can happen?!\u201d\nFast forward to now\u2026 \ud83e\udd2d\nShe\u2019s getting 3\u20135 PR packages a WEEK. YAY!\nShe\u2019s already made over $1,250 in paid brand deals. AMAZING!!\nAnd she has just 6.2k followers!!\nLike\u2026 are you kidding?! That\u2019s what happens when you believe in yourself and use the right strategy!\nInside Influencer Insider, I break down exactly what she did:\nHow to find the right brand contacts\nCreate emails they can\u2019t ignore\nTurn PR into paid opportunities\nCreate content that gets noticed (and reposted!)\nI\u2019m not promising overnight success. She showed up, stayed consistent, and followed every step. But she\u2019s proof that it works!!\nAnd guess what? I\nknow\nyou can do it too!!\nJoin Influencer Insider today for a one time payment of $28.00 (not a subscription)\u2014 it\u2019s worth WAY more, think of all the success you can absolutely have!\nBecause this is about\nsupporting you\n\u2014 not gatekeeping the industry secrets!! too many gatekeepers in this world!\nClick Here To Join Influencer Insider\nAnd I\u2019m ALSO including my personal contact list of 300+ brand emails. Let\u2019s get you on those PR lists & build brand relationships!\nDreams become reality all the time\u2026 they did for me, they did for her, and they can for YOU too. \ud83e\udef6\nYou got this!!\nMuch love,\nFiona"

The ONLY thing that changed was how I approached brands!!\nI'm sharing this because I don't want you to waste months like I did.\nIn tomorrow's email, I'm sending you a free template that's helped girls in my community land their first PR partnerships!! :)\nYour perfectly packaged PR & brand relationships that PAYYY is closer than you think!\nMuch love,\nFiona\nP.S. 2 of my close friends are influencer managers and\u00a0 90% of influencers approach brands completely wrong.

Research the right contact person - Never send to generic \"info@\" emails (they're literally black holes for PR requests a NO NO)\n2. Customize each email outreach - Brands can smell a copy-pasted template from miles away\ud83e\uddcd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f(it shows brands your not that interested in them)\n3. Show specific value - Explain exactly how your content style matches their brand (with screenshot examples to stand out!)\n4. Follow up strategically - The magic often happens in the follow-up (I'll share my exact timeline below)\n5. Stand out visually - Use design elements (or photos) in your email! That make you instantly memorable!! \u2728\nAnd here are the 5 things that get your emails deleted immediately:\nDON'T:\n1. Focus on follower count - Starting with \"I have X followers\" screams amateur ah!\n2. Write paragraphs about yourself - Brands care about what you can do for THEM \ud83d\udc40\n3. Use generic compliments - \"I love your brand!\" means nothing without specifics details.\n4. Send the same message to competitors - Brands talk to each other more than you think\u2026\n5. Give up after one attempt - most successful PR partnerships happen after the 2nd or 3rd contact! :)\nIf you missed my last email with the list of 20 brands actively seeking micro influencers right now,\nclick here.\nBeing an influencer (making money & getting PR) is tough, which is why I'm sharing these insider secrets most established creators won't tell you. I've been on both sides of this, and I want to be the guide I wish I had!! Because OH MY\u2026 it can be overwhelming.\nALSO Here\u2019s the most successful follow-up schedule I've seen is: first email \u2192 wait 5 days \u2192 follow-up #1 \u2192 wait 7 days \u2192 follow-up #2.

Is this a scam?\u201d\nI completelyyy get it.\nIf I were in your position, getting an unexpected email about free PR and paid deals, I'd be cautious, too!!\nSooo let\u2019s clear the air:\nCheck my pinned TikTok @fionafrills\nI just posted a quick video update: you\u2019ll see me talking face-to-face about this exact Influencer Insider project. Just search @FionaFrills on TikTok, my page should pop right up with 200k followers also my other account is @FionaFrillsDiary. Or click here to see me talking more about this:\nTikTok Video (It's around the 2 minute mark)\nGoogle \u201cFrilliance CVS Walmart\u201d\nYou\u2019ll see images of my beauty brand, Frilliance, on store shelves (so cool ah!!) and some press coverage about it.

If you are excited to dive deeper into the influencer world:\nComing Up Next: The Bigger System\nI\u2019ve hinted at a\ncomplete, step-by-step system\nto not just\none\nor 2 PR boxes, but to build ongoing paid collaborations with brands that truly value you, regardless of follower count (there\u2019s so many ways you can offer value). I\u2019ll share all the details in my next email!\nSpoiler:\nIt\u2019s a simple system I created after seeing the influencer world from both sides:\nAs a content creator\nwith 1M+ YouTube subscribers\nAs a brand owner\nwho\u2019s sent out thousandsss of PR boxes and negotiated 6-figure deals\nI call it\nInfluencer Insider\n, and it\u2019s available in just a couple of days (for a crazy-low price, btw). But before we get to the official details, I had to make sure we\u2019re on the same page about one thing:\nYes\n\u2014I\u2019m the real Fiona, and\nyes\n, I\u2019m genuinely here to help smaller creators land the brand deals they deserve!!!\nThank you for being here\u2014and for trusting me enough to open these emails.
